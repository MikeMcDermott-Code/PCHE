The following README file contains instructions for the OpenFOAM package for the macro scale printed circuit heat exchanger. Full paper found here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nucengdes.2024.113084
The work in the paper is tested for an Airfin HX. There is an additional case for a zig-zag geometry with 2 inlet and outlets, both in Cases.

------- Preamble ------- 

- Download OpenFOAMv2212 with precompiled libraries (this is a quicker install). Follow the instructions
in the link: https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam/-/wikis/precompiled/debian

- The overall file structure contains the Cases, fvOptions library (for the Nusselt number heat transfer),
and the solver.

- Go to the directory mySolvers/mychtMultiRegionFoam/mychtMultiRegionSimpleFoam. Run the command:

wclean
wmake

- Similarly go to the directory myLibs/fvOptions. Run the command:

wclean
wmake

------- Some Notes ------- 

- The Cases directory contains the 2 developed cases for the Airfin HX and ZigZag HX. The file systems are very similar but are separated for easy use.

- The Variables.txt file contains key variables such as inlet temperature, Nusselt number values etc. The relevant #include code is used throughout the case so that the user only needs to adjust this file.

- The Geometry.txt file contains key values such as channel length, channel width etc. This is important for the Mesh construction in Cases/<CaseName>/<region>/system/blockMeshDict.

- The Cases/<CaseName>/<region>/constant directory contains porousZones where you can specify the friction factor terms. The naming of the cellZones here are linked back to the blockMeshDict file (e.g. RegionI, RegionII...).

- The thermophysicalProperties file is dynamically linked to the thermoData directory, which has tabulated data based on pressure values.

------- Running the case ------- 

- Go to the Case file of interest, e.g. Cases/Airfin. Run the command:

./run

- This will run the case based on the time steps and runtime specified in controlDict. To track residuals, run the command:

gnuplot Residuals.txt

- To clean the directory run the command:

./clean

- Paraview can be used to check results.

------- Feedback and questions ------- 

For any issues or debugging, please email and I can make those changes. Thank you :)
